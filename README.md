# Halo Custom Edition Setup
 This repository provides a guide for installing and setting up Halo Custom Edition, a popular modification of the original Halo: Combat Evolved game. The setup instructions include downloading the necessary files, installing the game, applying essential patches, and connecting to an alternitive dedicated server after the GameSpy service shutdown. This allows players to enjoy custom content and multiplayer gameplay seamlessly. 
 
 I have included an extra program for sharing.
